        <p> Our organization's goal is to utalize drones to prevent deforestation in the Amazon rainforest. In 2019 125,000 hectares were cleared and burned by farmers for cattle-ranching.
          By using drones to monitor the areas in which there are more fires being sited. The Brazilian goverment is not certain whether or not the clearing and burning of the forest is legal. The drones could be use to veiw places where the burning is legal and to find place where the clearing and burning is illegal.

        <p>Industrialization disrupts the ecosystem which is
        Killing animas which causes a ripples  effect. If the producers are killed off then it will slowly work itself up the chain and destory the consumers. Many animals are losing their habitats;we have yet to discover every species in the Amazon rainforest. Humans could be killing an animal species that could have the cure of different ailments.

        The first graph shows how much of the Amazon rainforest is being destroyed. The second graph were taken by NASA to show the public Cambodia's deforestation rates. Between 2001 and 2013 Cabodia lost 1.59 million hectacres. Not only is the Amazon rainforest being affected but, many forest throughout the world.</p>
